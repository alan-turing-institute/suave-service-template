Template for The Gamma REST services
====================================

 * Rename `suave-service-template.sln` to whatever you wish and change 
   `build` target in `build.fsx` to use your new file name
   
 * Add services as `fsx` files in `src/servers` and add them 
   to `src/services.fsproj` (find the section containing `demo.fsx`).
   The order matter.
